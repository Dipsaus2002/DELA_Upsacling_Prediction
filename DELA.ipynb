    "<b>Project explanation</b><br>\n",
    "Dela was faced with unprecedented challenge by the fluctuating demands during the Covid19 first year, and that way they are looking to enhance their abilities to react to surprising serge or drops in demands.\n",
    "We cannot predict when Dela needs to upscale or downscale. However, we can forecast the amount of deaths in the upcoming years. Based on that knowledge and Dela experience, they can conclude themselves when to upscale or downscale.<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Project goal</b><br>\n",
    "In our project, we are going to forecast the amount of deaths per year. In this way we can help them conclude easier what to do on higher, lower demand.<br><br><br>\n",
    "<b>Document explanation</b><br>\n",
    "In this document there will be the testing and implementation of the project delivered proposal hypothesis. In this document, we will do that by understanding and experimenting with the collected data. After the understanding, we will see if our hypothesis can be validated and we will do that by applying machine learning onto our dataset.<br><br>\n",
